# Waste Classification – Week 1: Machine Learning Foundations

This repository contains my work for Week 1 of the Shell Internship under the Green Skills theme.  
The focus of this week was to understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning and practice using key Python libraries before starting the main Waste Classification project.


## Week 1 Objectives
- Understand basic Machine Learning concepts and workflows  
- Learn to use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization  
- Explore data preprocessing techniques  
- Build and train a simple CNN model using the MNIST dataset  


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/waste-classification-week1.git
   cd waste-classification-week1
