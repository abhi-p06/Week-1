Waste Classification using CNN
Overview

This is my Week 1 project for the AI Internship. I'm new to machine learning and wanted to understand how image classification works using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Since real waste datasets are large, I used TensorFlow’s small built-in flower dataset to practice CNN basics and project structure.

Problem Statement

To train a simple CNN model that classifies images into different categories. This helped me learn how CNNs process image data and recognize visual patterns.

What I Learned

Basics of CNN layers and architecture

Loading and preprocessing image data

Training and evaluating a model

Visualizing accuracy and loss

Dataset

Used TensorFlow’s built-in flower_photos dataset. It’s small, automatically downloads, and works well for quick experiments.

Tools and Libraries

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Outcome

The model classifies flower images into 5 categories with around 70–80% accuracy. This project helped me learn CNN fundamentals before moving to real waste data.

Week 1 Goal

Learn CNN basics, train a simple image classification model, and understand the workflow of a machine learning project.
